    <h4>
      <p>The Caipirinha is Brazil’s national cocktail; made with cachaça, sugar and lime and sometimes with other local fruits. Cachaça, also known as pinga, caninha, and a multitude of colloquial names, is Brazil’s most common distilled alcoholic beverage.
    </p>
      <p> The caju is the fruit of the cashew tree and is a kidney or boxing-glove shaped drupe that grows at the end of the cashew apple. The drupe develops first on the tree, and then the pedicel expands to become the cashew apple. Within the fruit is a single seed which is often considered a nut in the culinary sense.
